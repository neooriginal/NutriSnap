## Quick start

### What you need

- [Node.js 18 or newer](https://nodejs.org)
- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (used for food photo analysis and coaching)

### 1 · Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/you/nutrisnap
cd nutrisnap
npm install
```

### 2 · Add your API key

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your key here...
JWT_SECRET=any-long-random-string-you-choose
```

### 3 · Start

```bash
npm start
```

Open **http://localhost:3000**, create an account, and you're in.

## Connecting Claude (or any AI assistant)

NutriSnap has a built-in MCP server that lets AI assistants read your food log, check your fasting status, and even log meals for you — just by asking.

**Setup takes two steps:**

**Step 1 — Generate your key**  
Open the app → tap your profile → scroll to **AI assistant access** → tap **Generate key**.  
Copy the key shown (you'll only see the full key once).

**Step 2 — Add to Claude Desktop**  
Open your Claude Desktop config file (`~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`) and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nutrisnap": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3001/sse",
      "headers": {
        "x-api-key": "ns_your_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. You can now ask things like:
- *"What did I eat today and how many calories is that?"*
- *"Log 200g of chicken breast for lunch"*
- *"How is my fast going?"*
- *"Am I on track for my weight goal?"*

---

## Running with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

That's it. The app will be available at **http://localhost:3000**.

> Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET` to a `.env` file in the project folder before starting.

---

## Privacy

All your data is stored in a single SQLite file on your own machine (`data/food_tracker.db`).  
Nothing is sent anywhere except to OpenAI when you analyse a food photo or ask for AI coaching.  
You can delete your data at any time by deleting that file.
